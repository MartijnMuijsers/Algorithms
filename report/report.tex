\section*{\begin{center} Guidelines for DBL Algorithms reports \\ {\normalsize M. de Berg} \end{center}}
This document contains guidelines for the report that has to be written for the course
\emph{DBL Algorithms} (2IO90). It serves several purposes. First of all, it describes the structure
your document should have: the sections it should contain,
the general contents of those sections and their maximum length.
Second, it explains which (parts of the) sections should already be written for
the intermediate report that has to be handed in at the end of the fourth week of the project.
Finally, it gives some hints on how to write certain sections.
The main part of this document---everything except the current page---is
written in the same format your paper should have.

You may use the \LaTeX source file of this document as a template for your report.
For your convenience I have already added commands for theorems, proof, etcetera,
which can be used by writing, for example:
\verb#\begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}#.

\section*{About the intermediate and the final report}
The report for this {\sc dbl} project should be written in the form of a paper.
This means that you should write it as if you want to submit it to a scientific
journal. Thus, do not write things like ``For the course 2IO90 we had to write a report
on reconstructing curves and networks.''. There are several requirements for
the reports:
\begin{itemize}
\item The reports should be written using 11\;pt font, and it should be for A4 paper 
      with reasonable (not too large) margins. If you use \LaTeX for preparing
      your paper---this is the preferred way of doing it---then use
      \verb#\usepackage{a4wide}#.
\item The maximum total length of the
      final report is 20~pages. This includes everything from the title and abstract until
      the references. Do not use appendices. You do not need to use all 20 pages,
      although if you use significantly less than 20 pages it is likely that
      your paper is not sufficiently detailed or clear, that your experimental evaluation is
      not extensive enough, or that your paper could profit from more figures.
      The minimum number of pages is~16.
\item The number of pages for the intermediate report should be at least 8 and at most~11.
      It should contain (most of) Section~\ref{se:introduction}, Section~\ref{se:algorithms},
      and the references. You are expected to revise these sections for the final report, based
      on the feedback you get on the intermediate report and on your findings in the second half
      of the project. 
\end{itemize}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In the abstract you give an overview---typically one short paragraph---of the contents of
your paper: you describe the problem you have studied, and what the main results are.
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}
\label{se:introduction}
\maxsize{2 pages}
The introduction usually starts with a description of and
a motivation for the general problem area.
%
\crp{You would start by
describing the general problem of object reconstruction from point data,
mention how data can be obtained (laser scanners), discuss network reconstruction, etcetera.}
%
After introducing the general problem area, you zoom in to the specific problem
studied in the paper. I like to already discuss previous work here. This way
you can explain where the specific problem fits into the state-of-the-art
and why it is interesting. Ideally, the discussion of the previous work
culminates in a clear statement about what is still missing in the current
state-of-the-art: namely an answer to the specific problem you study.
%
\crp{You would now discuss the specific variants that you study, 
what is known about them, which general reconstruction methods may or may not apply, and so on.}
%
Then you give an overview of your results.
%
\crp{You could give a high-level description of the
approach(es) you have used and relate them to approaches found in the literature.
State the theoretical guarantees (on running time,
for instance, or on other aspects) that you may have proved for your algorithms
and mention the main conclusions from the experiments.}
%
Finally, you can give an overview of the structure of the rest of your paper.
Personally, however, I do not find these overviews very useful: I prefer to
integrate this with the previous part of the introduction, where the overview
of the results is given.

\section{The algorithms}
\label{se:algorithms}
\maxsize{8 pages. Use subsections where appropriate.}
%
The description of the algorithms should be such that a programmer can
implement them without much difficulty. It is good practice to first explain the
main ideas behind the algorithm at a more intuitive level, and then give a
detailed description (for example using pseudo-code).
Don't forget to describe which supporting data structures you use:
linked lists, arrays, search trees, and so on. For standard data structures
from the literature you do not need to explain how they work; a reference
to the literature suffices.
%
\example{We store the set $P$ of points in a red-black tree~\cite{clrs-ia-01},
         using the $x$-coordinate of each point as its key.}
%
Try to theoretically analyze the worst-case running time of your algorithms
and the amount of storage they use. Also try to say something about the quality of your algorithm: you might
be able to prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to find the correct solution if the
input has certain well-defined properties, or you might be able to give examples
of inputs for which the algorithm will fail to give a correct solution.


\section{Experimental evaluation}
\label{se:evaluation}
\maxsize{8 pages. Use subsections where appropriate.}
Describe the experiments (for example how you generated the input and on which machine you
ran the experiments), give the results of the experiments (in the form of tables or graphs),
and discuss the results. Here you can also include pictures of your output for a few tests.
Relate the outcome of the experiments to your theoretical analysis.

Note that the experimental data in itself are not the main result: the conclusions
you can draw are what makes the data interesting.





\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{se:conclusions}
\maxsize{1 page}
Give a short overview of the main results, discussing both the strong
points of your algorithms as well as their weak points, and ideas for improvements
(``future work'').

Make sure your references are well-polished and complete.
References are typically to books and to papers in scientific
journals and conference proceedings. References to web pages are hardly
ever appropriate.
The list of references is usually ordered alphabetically by first author (although some journals
list them in the order they are cited for the first time in the paper).
Only put in references that are actually cited in your paper.
Formatting can be done as in the example above---note that these references have
nothing to do with the topic of the DBL-project---, following the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item for journals:
      Authors. Title of paper. \emph{Journal Name (italic)} volume: page numbers (year).
      See reference~\cite{m-apca-83}.
\item for conference proceedings:
      Authors. Title of paper. In \emph{Proc. Conference Name and number (italic)}, pages xxx--yyy, year.
      See reference~\cite{a-raoa-02}
\item for books: Authors. \emph{Book title (italic)}. publisher, year.
      See reference~\cite{clrs-ia-01}
\end{itemize}
Note that names of journals and conferences are usually abbreviated. There is a more
or less standard way of doing this (for example, \emph{J. ACM} is stands for \emph{Journal of the ACM},
but how you do it exactly is not so important,
as long as you are consistent and list all the necessary information.
